Feature:

Video stations need to send their data up to mdss

Details:

There will be a project folder on the video computer ( we have 2 video
computers now, one in the MAC and a second in Auer Hall) which will contain
the following: 

- a video subfolder containing the FCP project, including source video
- One or more rendered .mov files
- One or more DVD .img files

These should be treated in the same way as the audio assets, the subfolder
will be sent to MDSS via htar, and the .mov and .img files will be sent via
hsi with associated checksums. One additional step, the .img files will need
to be copied to the access directory of the associated project file on the
server. In Travis's scripts it worked like this: on the corresponding audio
computer a 'video' subfolder was created in the project directory to alert the
script that video exists for the project. The script waited for access folders
in both the audio and video project directories before the concert was
processed.

Notes:

1. empty video dir on audio workstation indicates that there is video

 mounts video computer

 in videoComputer:/projectdir/access/*.img get copied to server access folder

 everything else is left, until sent to MDSS.
