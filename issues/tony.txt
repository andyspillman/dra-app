Feature:

You should work directly with Tony on this since his requirements are slightly
different. I would like his projects to use their own backup folder so we
don't confuse projects, and his assets do not need to be stored on the server,
they can be deleted once they have made it to MDSS and Variations. I'll have
Tony contact you directly.
