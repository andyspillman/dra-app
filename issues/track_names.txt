Problem:

When a concert is copied to the concert_archive folder the first track's name
is changed from 'Ambience' to 'End'. The track name is correct in the version
in the backup folder. I did a test – I manually ran the backup script on a
test folder, the behavior was the same – correct track name in the backup
folder, incorrect in the concert_archive folder

Questions:

1. Does this happen every time?

2. The track name is getting re-written in the wav file? So, somewhere in the
header?
 - difficult to pin-down the problem since the backup and transfer process are
   both the same, each replying on rsync.
