Problem:
    Delete script hangs when it can't delete a file on the remote station

Desc:
Presently the delete script is hanging when it encounters a file that it can't
delete. There is a file on the MAC PC that is doing this, it looks
like the script runs normally until it encounters this file, then it never
exits leaving the MAC share mounted which cause the MAC scripts to bail on
subsequent runs. 

Error Message:
scripts/mac-delete.sh did not run properly. Error code was 2304 :
rm: /Users/audiopro/Applications/DRA/mount/20110721_2000_aud_vac1248:
Operation not permitted
Failed to remove 20110721_2000_aud_vac1248 from remote station at
/Users/audiopro/Applications/DRA/bin/dra-delete line 351

Fix:
Couldn't figure out the folder would delete.  Was able to reproduce the
problem, except for the hanging part.  To that end, I modified the script to
unmount the share before it croaks from a failure.
