access and pres files are stored in the same folder on mdss:
 - remove access folder creation on mdss side
 - remove access path in the hsiPut commands
 - anything else???


renamed backup.pl to dra-backup
 - re-edited variables


need to add in user and pass variables
created dra-run script


edit dra-run:
 - recursion to loop through a whole semester's content
 - logging
 - edited DRA.pm to account for renamed files
 - Jira works
 - email notifications: send marc record out
 - error collection

created dra-notify

added -help options and PEDANTIC settings to AppConfig for all scripts

edited dra-transfer to copy wave files to burn folder

created dra-delete -- still need to test it with real data

verified dra-backup does the same thing as backup.pl

added burn log output
copy files from burn list to burn folder

Wrote up documentation

added .tar extension to htar files
tar archive now has paths relative to the project directory and not /

dra-transfer and dra-mdss are croaking accordingly. Konrad asked about this,
and I didn't remember... nice to know I did the right thing the first time!

Backup script verifies validity of project dir before it transfers and sends
out an error message if it doesn't

add doc extensions to various lists and ensured doc files are getting to MDSS

Added correct environment vars for htar commands

Tar files not getting named properly

Aug. 2010

Updated setPermissions to 664 for files
Added additional setPermissions routine to dra-transfer

Sep. 2010

Added bit to dra-transfer that checks for the presence of a rsync.log

To do:

Update marc and Jira documentation for dra-run

re-transfer script?

add variable for permissions under setPermissions routine

Little things:

1. review error actions
    - are we croaking when we should be using main::error ?
    - are we using main::error when we should be croaking ?

Things I Can't do:

1. Applescript that changes folder color
    - requires window server running
