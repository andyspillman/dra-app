\&\fBdra-video [\-help] [\-f] [video.conf options] [project_directory]\fR
.SH "REQUIRED ARGUMENTS"
.IX Header "REQUIRED ARGUMENTS"
A \fBproject directory\fR is required for the script to run. This must be the
full path the directory.  For example:
.PP
\&\fBdra-video /Volumes/audio/Concerts/2010_fall/20100923vab1234\fR
.SH "OPTIONS"
.IX Header "OPTIONS"
\&\fB\-help\fR Displays brief synopsis of usage.
.PP
\&\fB\-f\fR Force flag.  The project will be transferred regardless of any errors or
if the concert was successfully sent at an earlier time.
.PP
\&\fBvideo.conf\fR Any setting from the video.conf file may be passed to the script
at runtime in the format:
.PP
\&\-[variable name] [value]
.PP
Example:
.PP
\&\fBdra-video \-email joebob@indiana.edu [directory]\fR
.PP
Will execute the script overriding the email address specified in video.conf
with joebob@indiana.edu
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This script works in conjunction with dra-transfer to coordinate transfers of
video files to the main dra server and to \s-1MDSS\s0. Whereas dra-transfer and
dra-mdss are intended to be run from a single machine or server where audio
data is \*(L"pulled\*(R" from different workstations, dra-video is designed to be run
on multiple workstations where video data is \*(L"pushed\*(R" to both the main dra
server and mdss.
.PP
Processing a project directory will take two executions of the dra-video
script.  On the first pass, the script will first check for properly named
files and folders.  If these are correct, it will next create a text listing
of files and send them to the main dra server.  A corresponding project
directory will already exist on the main dra server with any relevant audio
data.  Once this file listing is copied to the server, the dra-transfer script
will be able to complete its transfer of audio data to Variations and \s-1MDSS\s0.
See the documentation for dra-transfer and dra-mdss for more information.
.PP
On the second pass of the script, dra-video logs into the main dra server to
determine if both dra-transfer and dra-mdss have completed successfully. Upon
the successful complete of both those scripts, dra-video will transfer dvd
image files to the main dra server, and then transfer all video files to \s-1MDSS\s0.
 Individual video files are transferred via \s-1HSI\s0, and are re-downloaded to
verify md5 sums.  Folders of video files are transferred via \s-1HTAR\s0.
.PP
The last step of the script is to copy the video transfer log to the dra
server for additional storage.
.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.IX Header "DIAGNOSTICS"
Upon successful completion of the script, dra-video returns no output.
Otherwise, errors are reported to \s-1STDOUT\s0 as well as an error log file in the
project log directory.  Additional information about the scripts overall
progress is written to a script-level log file under the script log directory.
 By default, this is the logs directory in the application's home directory.
.SH "CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT"
.IX Header "CONFIGURATION AND ENVIRONMENT"
A properly configured video.conf file should be sufficient for dra-video
script to run. The format is the same as the dra.conf file and has many
duplicated values. However, there is no shared information in either of the
configuration files.  So any relevant changes to dra.conf must also be
duplicated in video.conf and vice versa.
.PP
The \s-1DRA_HOME\s0 environment variable is required and can be set on a per-user
basis or at execution time.
.SH "DEPENDENCIES"
.IX Header "DEPENDENCIES"
\&\s-1HTAR\s0 and \s-1HSI\s0 are required to send the files to \s-1MDSS\s0.  These applications are
available through \s-1IU\s0's mass datastore service.  See
http://kb.iu.edu/data/auvo.html for the latest client builds available.
.PP
You will also need to create kerberos keytab files to enable automate access
to the mdss account. For more information on creating keytab files, see
http://kb.iu.edu/data/avdb.html.
